# 1. Overview

This roadmap document defines the broader GeoCAT scope with tasks and 
activities under scope items, then provides a high level schedule that 
GeoCAT will tentatively employ throughout 2023 to achieve the deliverables 
and milestones out of those activities.

## 1.1. Community involvement

GeoCAT welcomes and needs community input and feedback on this roadmap as 
well as development activities throughout the year. That helps us ensure 
we address community needs for geoscience data analysis and visualization.

## 1.2. GeoCAT Scope

The scope of the GeoCAT project is based on three essential objectives of 
the GeoCAT group: 

1. Development of geoscientific data analysis and visualization tools, 
2. Open development & community engagement,
3. Scalability

## 1.3. How to read this roadmap?

Under each objective (i.e. scope item) in section 2, the main tasks on which 
the GeoCAT team will work on are listed (2.1.1, 2.1.2, ...).

For each task, activities are also defined  (i, ii, iii, ...). Deliverables 
and/or milestones are also defined for activities when applicable.

## 1.4. How to give feedback & input to this roadmap?

Each task under every GeoCAT objective mostly corresponds to a separate 
software package or GitHub asset of GeoCAT's. Therefore, we will provide 
links to Github dicussions for each task in this document, where you can let 
us hear your voice. That way, we can ensure an open community conversation, 
virtually about anything.

If you are not comfortable with GitHub discussions, you can always reach out 
to us via our email: geoact@ucar.edu
