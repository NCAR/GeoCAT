## Contributing

### Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GeoCAT project.
GeoCAT is made up of a very small amount of developers, tasked with
supporting more than one project, so we rely on outside contributions
to help keep the project moving forward.

The guidelines below help to ensure that the developers and outside
collaborators remain on the same page regarding contributions.


### Source Code

The source code is available on GitHub:

* [PyNGL](https://github.com/NCAR/pyngl)
* [PyNIO](https://github.com/NCAR/pynio)
* [WRF-Python](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf-python)
* [PyNComp](https://github.com/NCAR/pyncomp)


### Git Flow

This project follows the GitFlow Workflow, which you can read about here if it
is new to you:

https://leanpub.com/git-flow/read

For external contributors, this isn't important, other than making you aware
that when you first clone the repository, you will be on the
**develop** branch, which is what you should use for your development.

Since you will be submitting pull requests for your contributions, you don't
really need to know much about GitFlow, other than making sure that you
are not developing off of the master branch.


### Ways to Contribute

Users are encouraged to contribute various ways. This includes:

- Submitting a bug report
- Submitting bug fixes
- Submitting new Fortran computational routines
- Submitting new Python computational routines
- Submitting fully wrapped computational routines
- Fixing documentation errors
- Creating new examples in the documentation (e.g. plotting examples)
