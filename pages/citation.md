## <img align="center" width="10%" height="10%" src="/images/GeoCAT_Final_Logos-03.svg"> How to Cite GeoCAT

The GeoCAT project has a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which is a persistent identifier for 
web-based resources. The benefit of DOIs is that they are widely accepted by academic publishers
as citable locators for scholarly objects. The GeoCAT DOI, when used in URL form, 
[https://doi.org/10.5065/a8pp-4358](https://doi.org/10.5065/a8pp-4358), provides a persistent link to the 
GeoCAT web page, and can be used to cite the GeoCAT project as a whole.

In addition, each GeoCAT tool is assigned a separate Digital Object Identifier (DOI) per version to allow
users to access older releases. This ensures that users are not only able to cite the specific
software version through DOIs but are also able to download & use the corresponding release for
reproducibility purposes.

If you author a paper that involves data analysis and/or visualization performed with the use of any 
GeoCAT software, we would like to ask you to please cite GeoCAT software toolkits you used. This helps 
(1) us better understand the impact of the software on the scientific community, which in turn helps us 
maintain support for the effort, as well as (2) make the research made with scientific software tools 
reproducible.


### Citing the whole GeoCAT effort

You can cite the entire GeoCAT project using the following citation text:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (Year).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit. Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR - Computational 
and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5065/a8pp-4358.**


### Citing GeoCAT software packages

If you would like to cite any GeoCAT software without referring to a specific version, use
the following text:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (Year).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: \<Software package name\> [Software].
Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:\<DOI\>.**

In the above citation text, update the software package name as appropriate. DOI for each GeoCAT 
software tool can be found in their own GitHub repository or documentation.

Instead, if you would like to cite a specific version of any GeoCAT software, use the following 
text:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (Year).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: GeoCAT-comp (v\<version\>) [Software].
Boulder, CO, USA: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:\<DOI\>.**

In the above citation text, update the year, GeoCAT package version, and DOI as appropriate. For example,
if you used version 2022.04.0 of GeoCAT-comp (i.e. computational component of GeoCAT):

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (2022).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: GeoCAT-comp (v2022.04.0) [Software].
Boulder, CO, USA: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5281/zenodo.6607349.**

URLs to version-specific DOIs for each GeoCAT software tool can be found in their own GitHub repository 
or documentation.
