## <img align="center" width="10%" height="10%" src="/images/GeoCAT_Final_Logos-03.svg"> How to Cite GeoCAT

GeoCAT has a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which is a persistent identifier for web-based resources. 
The GeoCAT DOI, when used in URL form, https://doi.org/10.5065/a8pp-4358, provides a persistent link to 
the GeoCAT web page. The benefit of DOIs is that they are widely accepted by academic publishers as citable 
locators for scholarly objects.

If you author a paper that involves data analysis and/or visualization performed with the use of any 
GeoCAT software, we would like to ask you to please cite GeoCAT. This helps us better understand the impact 
of the software on the scientific community, which in turns helps us maintain support for the effort.

You can cite GeoCAT using the following citation:

Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (Year). 
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (Version <version_used>) [Software]. 
Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5065/A8PP-4358.

You will need to update the GeoCAT version and year as appropriate. For example:

Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (2021). 
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (Version 2021.04.0) [Software]. 
Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5065/A8PP-4358.
