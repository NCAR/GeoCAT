## <img align="center" width="10%" height="10%" src="/images/GeoCAT_Final_Logos-03.svg"> How to Cite GeoCAT

GeoCAT has a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which is a persistent identifier for web-based resources. 
The GeoCAT DOI, when used in URL form, [https://doi.org/10.5065/a8pp-4358](https://doi.org/10.5065/a8pp-4358), 
provides a persistent link to the GeoCAT web page. The benefit of DOIs is that they are widely accepted by 
academic publishers as citable locators for scholarly objects.

If you author a paper that involves data analysis and/or visualization performed with the use of any 
GeoCAT software, we would like to ask you to please cite GeoCAT software toolkits you used. This helps 
us better understand the impact of the software on the scientific community, which in turn helps us 
maintain support for the effort.

### Citing GeoCAT software packages

You can cite any GeoCAT software using the following citation format:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (Year). 
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (\<Software package name\> version \<version_number\>) [Software]. 
Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5065/A8PP-4358.**

You will need to update the GeoCAT software and its version as well as year as appropriate. For example, 
if you used version 2021.04.0 of GeoCAT-comp (i.e. computational component of GeoCAT):

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (2021). 
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT-comp version 2021.04.0) [Software]. 
Boulder, CO: UCAR/NCAR - Computational and Informational System Lab. doi:10.5065/A8PP-4358.**
