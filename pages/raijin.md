Project Raijin, with its original title "Collaborative Research:
EarthCube Capabilities: Raijin: Community Geoscience Analysis
Tools for Unstructured Mesh Data", has been awarded by NSF 21-515
EarthCube for an award period of 1 September, 2021 - 31 August,
2024.

The Raijin administration team is a consortium between NCAR and 
Pennsylvania State University. The GeoCAT team will be responsible 
for the development of the Python visualization and analysis 
functions. While doing so, GeoCAT will ensure that an open 
development environment is established, the implementation work is 
well documented, and the deployments are well aligned with the 
project milestones as well as Scientific Python Ecosystem 
requirements and specifications.
