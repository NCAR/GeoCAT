# Welcome

**Geo**science **C**ommunity **A**nalysis **T**oolkit (**GeoCAT**), established in 2019, leads the software
engineering efforts of the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR) Computational and Information
Systems Lab (CISL)’s “Pivot to Python” initiative. Support for GeoCAT is provided by the **U.S. National
Science Foundation**.

GeoCAT essentially aims at creating scalable data analysis and visualization tools for Earth System Science
data to serve the geosciences community in the scientific Python ecosystem. GeoCAT tools are built upon the
cornerstone technologies in the **Pangeo** stack such as **Xarray**, **Dask**, and **Jupyter Notebooks**.
Novel research and development is conducted for analyzing/visualizing **structured** as well as
**unstructured grid** data from various research fields such as climate, weather, atmosphere, ocean, etc.
In addition, some of the functionalities in the GeoCAT stack are inspired/reimplemented from NCL (NCAR
Command Language).

The GeoCAT team is committed to open development, which prioritizes community involvement at any level
of the project lifecycle, from requirements and specification to testing and deployment, alongside having
the whole software stack open-sourced.
