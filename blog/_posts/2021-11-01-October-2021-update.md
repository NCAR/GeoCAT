Dear GeoCAT Community,

We have some great news this month such as the recently 
awarded Project Raijin! Please find below our October, 2021 
update including the Project Raijin details as well as regular 
GeoCAT releases and community activities:  

### Project Raijin

Project Raijin, with its original title "Collaborative Research: 
EarthCube Capabilities: Raijin: Community Geoscience Analysis 
Tools for Unstructured Mesh Data", has been awarded by NSF 21-515 
EarthCube for an award period of 1 September, 2021 - 31 August, 
2024. 

Check out the [Raijin website](https://raijin.ucar.edu/) for further 
information!

#### - Raijin - SEATS Collaboration

The Simplifying ESM Analysis Through Standards (SEATS) project is a 
collaborative effort of Argonne National Laboratory, UC Davis, and
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Project Raijin and SEATS share
several significant objectives in common as well aim at open development 
for the geoscientific community's good; therefore, the two teams 
have decided to collaborate on overlapping efforts. 

The Github [UXARRAY organization](https://github.com/UXARRAY) and the 
[uxarray](https://github.com/UXARRAY/uxarray) repository are the first 
actions of this collaboration in order to provide the community with a 
common Python package that supports reading in and recognizing 
unstructured grid models.

We welcome and appreciate any level of community contribution to this 
effort by giving feedback, reporting issues, joining us for implementation, 
etc. 

### Software Releases

#### - GeoCAT-comp October Release (v2021.10.0)!
With this release, a new function, interpolation of sigma to hybrid
coordinates (interp_sigma_to_hybrid), has been made available as 
result of a user request. In addition, bug fixes (e.g. on interp_hybrid_to_pressure 
as a user feedback) and documentation improvements have been performed.

- Please see
  [GeoCAT-comp v2021.10.0 Release](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/releases/tag/v2021.10.0)
  for further information.

[Contributor's Guide](https://geocat.ucar.edu/pages/contributing.html) 
for detailed information about our development stack. 

### Community Events

The GeoCAT team engaged with the community in October through several activities, 
some of which were as follows:

#### - Advanced Plotting Tutorial (October 27th)
Kudos to Anissa Zacharias for giving the [Advanced Plotting
tutorial](https://ncar.github.io/esds/posts/2021/advanced-plotting-tutorial/) at
Project Pythiaâ€™s NCAR/UCAR virtual Python Tutorial Seminar Series held by
[Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/).
Please see the [recorded video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqlHdFfGWo).

#### - Project Pythia Hackathon (October 28th)
Several GeoCAT team members participated in the Project Pythia hackathon and
made a number of contributions to the portal and foundations book on
October 28th.

As always we look forward to hearing your thoughts on our efforts.
