Dear GeoCAT Community,

The GeoCAT team would like to share a two-month update 
about GeoCAT releases and community activities in January and 
February, 2021 here:  

## February Updates

In February, the GeoCAT team was busy deploying new releases 
of the toolkits under the GeoCAT computational component 
([GeoCAT-comp](https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)).  

### - GeoCAT-comp v2021.02.0 Released!
With this release, several new functions, including anomally, 
climatology, dewtemp, EOF, and relhum, have been made available.

- Please see 
[GeoCAT-comp v2021.02.0 Release](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/releases/tag/v2021.02.0)
for further information about Release and Developer Notes.
- Refer to 
[GeoCAT-comp API reference](https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) 
for detailed information about the GeoCAT-comp functions.

### - GeoCAT-f2py v2021.02.0 Released!
GeoCAT-f2py wraps, in Python, the compiled language 
implementations of some of the computational functions 
found under the GeoCAT-comp umbrella. The end-users of 
GeoCAT-comp and/or developers basing their implementations 
entirely in Python need not concern themselves with GeoCAT-f2py.

For developers who are interested in the compiled language 
implementations of the GeoCAT-comp stack:

- Please see our 
[Contributor's Guide](https://geocat.ucar.edu/pages/contributing.html) 
for detailed information about our development stack. 

- Please see 
[GeoCAT-f2py v2021.02.0 Release](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py/releases/tag/v2021.02.0)
for further information about Release and Developer Notes.

## January Updates

In addition to our regular development activities, January was
a month of community engagement for the GeoCAT team as we attended
and presented in AMS 2021. Other than that, we have created a turorial 
video about GeoCAT software.

### - AMS 2021
- The GeoCAT team gave two poster presentations at AMS 2021:

  - Heather Rose Craker, Claire Anne Fiorino, Michaela Victoria 
  Sizemore, “[Rebuilding the NCL Visualization Gallery in Python
  ](https://ams.confex.com/ams/101ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/378236)”.
  
  - Orhan Eroglu, John Clyne, Austin Kootz, Michaela Victoria 
  Sizemore, Anissa Zacharias, “[Geoscience Community Analysis 
  Toolkit (GeoCAT
  )](https://ams.confex.com/ams/101ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/379186)”.

### - GeoCAT Tutorial Video
The "[GeoCAT Software Overview
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34zFGkDwJPc&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=GeoCAT)" 
tutorial video is up on our [homepage](https://geocat.ucar.edu/)!.

As always we look forward to hearing your thoughts on our efforts.

The GeoCAT Team - CISL/NCAR
