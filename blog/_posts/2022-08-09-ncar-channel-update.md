Dear GeoCAT users,

We would like to make an important announcement about our Conda releases 
of GeoCAT software packages:

The GeoCAT team has moved the Conda releases of several software tools 
(listed below) from the "NCAR" channel to the "conda-forge" channel only, 
effective after the v2022.07.* versions. From now on, please be sure to 
install GeoCAT tools from conda-forge for the latest version. For 
reproducibility purposes however, the older versions at the NCAR channel 
will still be accessible.

GeoCAT tools affected by this decision:
- GeoCAT-comp
- GeoCAT-f2py
- GeoCAT-viz
- GeoCAT-datafiles

The GeoCAT Team - CISL/NCAR
