Dear GeoCAT Community,

Our team would like to share March, 2021 update 
about GeoCAT releases and community activities below:  

### - GeoCAT-comp v2021.03.0 Released!
With this release, a vertical interpolation function, [interp_hybrid_to_pressure](
https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_api/generated/geocat.comp.interp_hybrid_to_pressure.html#geocat.comp.interp_hybrid_to_pressure) 
(Previously [vinth2p](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Functions/Built-in/vinth2p.shtml) in NCL), 
has been made available. In addition, improved continuous integration (CI) actions have been deployed
in several Github repositories of GeoCAT.

- Please see 
[GeoCAT-comp v2021.03.0 Release](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp/releases/tag/v2021.03.0)
for further information about Release and Developer Notes.
- Refer to 
[GeoCAT-comp API reference](https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) 
for detailed information about the GeoCAT-comp functions.

### - GeoCAT-comp Usage Examples Migrated to GeoCAT-Examples!
The computational functions of GeoCAT are documented with example scripts in addition to [GeoCAT-comp 
ReadTheDocs page](https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Contributor's Guide
](https://geocat.ucar.edu/pages/contributing.html), and repository-specific documentation at 
[GeoCAT-comp Github repository](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp). These examples are represented 
as Python scripts and their corresponding Jupyter notebooks, which may or may not contain 
visualizations (i.e. Matplotlib plots), depending on the function characteristics. 

Such usage examples were located in the [GeoCAT-comp Github repository](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp)
in the past; however, they have been migrated into [GeoCAT-Examples Gallery
](https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery-geocat-comp/index.html#) in March, because 
this gallery is aimed at containing all the visualization and usage examples of the GeoCAT stack. 

### - GeoCAT-f2py v2021.03.0 Released!
- Please see 
[GeoCAT-f2py v2021.03.0 Release](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py/releases/tag/v2021.03.0)
for further information about Release and Developer Notes.

- Please see our 
[Contributor's Guide](https://geocat.ucar.edu/pages/contributing.html) 
for detailed information about our development stack. 

## Community Events

In addition to our regular development activities, the GeoCAT team engaged 
with the community through a few virtual events in March.

### - Matplotlib Tutorial (March 24th)
Kudos to Anissa Zacharias for giving a Matplotlib tutorial at NCAR’s Python Tutorial Seminar Series
held by [Xdev Team](https://ncar.github.io/xdev/).
Please see the [recorded video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiPRIdHQEmE&ab_channel=ProjectPythia).

### - Numpy Tutorial (March 10th)
Kudos to Austin Kootz for giving a Numpy tutorial at NCAR’s Python Tutorial Seminar Series
held by [Xdev Team](https://ncar.github.io/xdev/).
Please see the [recorded video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kstc-6uz7AQ&ab_channel=ProjectPythia).

### - GeoCAT Presentation at AMP / CGD / NCAR (March 9th)
Kudos to everyone who attended GeoCAT presentation and had a great discussion session with us at 
"Climate Validation working group in the Atmospheric Modelling and Prediction (AMP) section in 
NCAR's Climate & Global Dynamics (CGD) Lab.

As always we look forward to hearing your thoughts on our efforts.

The GeoCAT Team - CISL/NCAR
