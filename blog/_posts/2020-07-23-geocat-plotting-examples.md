With the help of a new GeoCAT team member, Michaela Sizemore, and
two outstanding "SIParCS" summer interns, Rose Craker (Purdue U.)
and Claire Fiorino (SDSU), great progress has been made on the
[GeoCAT plotting example
gallery](https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  these
past couple of months. Nearly 40 new plotting examples have been
added to the gallery, providing Jupyter Notebook examples demonstrating
how to use Matplotlib (and Cartopy) for map projections, panel
plots, vector plots, streamlines, and much more.

In addition to the new gallery examples, new plotting convenience
functions have been added to
[GeoCAT-viz](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-viz) to facilitate
common plotting tasks such as tick mark and placement, finding local
extrema, and improved control over vector plot glyph placement.

We encourage you to make use of this valuable resource, and also
ask you to submit your ideas for new plots.  Just comment on this
blog post, or better yet, open an “issue” on the [GeoCAT-examples
GitHub repo](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-examples/issues). You
are welcome to contribute your own plots as well.

As always we look forward to hearing your thoughts on our efforts. 

The GeoCAT Team.
